Genetic-Algorithms
==================

This project was created for the course Algorithms and Datastructures III at the University of Ghent. It contains 2 implementations of a genetic algorithm to find the optimal position of points within a polygon, maximizing the spacing between each pair of points.

* Sequential implementation in C
* Parallel implementation in C, using the OpenMPI library
